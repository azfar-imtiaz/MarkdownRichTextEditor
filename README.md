# MarkdownRichTextEditor
This is a small SwiftUI application that contains a Markdown-infused rich text editor.

## Project Description
This project is my attempt at building a Rich Text Editor powered by markdown, in SwiftUI. The main idea is to build an editor that can seamlessly toggle between editing mode and display mode.

## Features
### Editing mode

### Display mode

### Keyboard toolbar

## Credits
I would like to credit [SwiftyMarkdown](https://github.com/SimonFairbairn/SwiftyMarkdown) for giving me a headstart by providing Markdown capabilities out of the box.
